#                                         ---------------------------GAME INFORMATION---------------------------

<br />

"Portal Quest" was a project that started off as a school project. The game is a puzzle game that works with the same logic as the game "Portal" made by Valve. The
player has two portals that they can project on **brown** walls, any object that passes through one portal will end up outside the other. The goal of the player is to
solve puzzles by using the ability to create portals.
